A close look at the chart action of KC & The Sunshine Band hits reveals an interesting trend. Every #1 single was followed up by a song that did not make the top 30. One exception was the #2 "Keep It Comin Love" that came after the #1 single "I'm Your Boogie Man". Then the reigning kings of disco gave up their crown to the upsurging Bee Gees, but got the last laugh. Their final #1 single was the tender ballad "Please Don't Go" which hit the pole position for the week ending January 5, 1980 and the distinction of being the very first #1 of the 80's. A departure from the rousing dance records, KC's emotive voice lent a plaintive air to the deceptively simple song. He was already stretching his wings on the solo side by teaming up with Teri DeSario (ex of the BeeGee penned disco hit "Ain't Nothing Gonna Keep Me From You) on "Yes, I'm Ready" which peaked at #2 for two weeks behind Queen's #1 hit 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love" during the spring of 1980. KC was in a serious head on car accident on January 15, 1982 not far from his home in Hialeah, FL.  The resulting injuries of a concussion and a pinched nerve caused him to lose all feeling on the right side of his body . He continued to record with the Sunshine Band, but the group eventually dissolved and TK Records went bankrupt. KC's recuperation involved learning how to walk again that took an entire year. In 1982, he released "All In A Night's Work" as KC,  which had the singles "You Said You'd Give Me Some More" and the poppy "Give It Up" which ended up being credited with the Sunshine Band. "Give It Up" got, a sprightly uptempo dance number that evoked the Sunshine Band recordings with the distinctive guitar lines, got released in Ireland and then the UK which resulted in his first #1 in the UK. KC had encountered resistance from Epic over the song and he fought to release it in the US. He ended up financing the release himself when the label flatly denied his request, so he licensed the song on his own independent MECA label in 1984. It peaked at #18 US pop that same year, a considerable feat when you remember that indie labels had lots of trouble competing with the big corporate labels for airplay. It was indicative of KC's magnetism...which you can see for yourself as he still tours today.
