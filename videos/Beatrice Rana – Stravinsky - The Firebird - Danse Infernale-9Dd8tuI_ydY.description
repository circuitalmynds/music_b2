Transcribed for piano by Guido Agosti, Stravinsky's mythical Firebird assumes a new sound under the masterful skill of Beatrice Rana. Discover the complete work on her album of Stravinsky and Ravel: https://wce.lnk.to/straLY

Beatrice's roots in Apulia, Lecce represent an integral part of her art. In this video, Lecce takes on the role of protagonist: scenes of Beatrice's own exploration, playing with the elements around her, getting lost within city and nature, are intertwined with images of attentive listeners, closed eyes, ears attuned to the soundtrack driving this experience: Stravinsky's Infernal Dance.
