THE SONGBIRD:  Halina Mickiewiczowna (1923 - 2001) was a popular Polish soprano who became especially known for her staccato singing. She studied with Ada Sari secretly for three years during the war, and made her debut at age 19 in Warsaw. After the war, she appeared regularly on the radio and toured throughout Poland. Her operatic roles included Rosina, Konstanze, and Adele. Mickiewiczowna was partially blind for many years and suffered from asthma. 

THE MUSIC: Bellini's "La Sonnambula" is a gem in the sub-genre of sentimental Italian opera semiseria. The opera premiered in Milan in 1831 with Giuditta Pasta as Amina, the sleepwalking character referred to in the title. The role is long and contains bel canto music demanding both aching lyricism and florid fireworks. The opera culminates with an exquisite final scene that has the shape of a bel canto mad scene, but here Amina has not lost her mind -- she is merely in a melancholy trance due to her sleepwalking. When Amina wakes up and realizes all is well, she launches into a bouncy and joyful cabaletta, "Ah, non giunge."
